# Antenna_pattern_and_design
1. Compute the radiation patterns of several [dipole antennas](dipole/).
2. Compute the radiation patterns of diverse types of [linear antenna-arrays](broadside_endfire/).
3. Design diverse types of linear antenna-arrays using [Fourier series](fourier/) and [Chebyshev polynomials](chebyshev/). 

**Example**: comparison of radiation patterns from 4 different end-fire arrays (see the code that generates this figure [here](broadside_endfire/null_spacing_Comparison.m))
