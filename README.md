# Antenna_pattern_and_design
1. Compute the radiation patterns of several [dipole antennas](dipole/).
2. Compute the radiation patterns of diverse types of **antenna-arrays**.
3. Design diverse types of **antenna-arrays**. 

**Example**: comparison of radiation patterns from 4 different end-fire arrays (see the code that generates this figure [here](broadside_endfire/null_spacing_Comparison.m))
