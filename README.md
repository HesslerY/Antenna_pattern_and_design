# Antenna_patterns
Design diverse types of antenna-arrays and compute their radiation patterns.

(see [here](http://www.idc-online.com/technical_references/pdfs/electronic_engineering/Antenna_arrays.pdf) some intro notes to antenna arrays)

**Example**: comparison of radiation patterns from 4 different end-fire arrays (see the code that generates this figure [here](broadside_endfire/null_spacing_Comparison.m))
