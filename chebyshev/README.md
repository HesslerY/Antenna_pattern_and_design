For a given antenna array (which you can design to follow a prescribed radiation pattern [using a truncated Fourier series](../fourier)), you can determine the current distributions that will result in the **narrowest main lobe for a specified side lode level**. This can be done using a **Chebyshev** distribution as in this code.

Example of a 6-element broadside array, with element spacing of half-wavelength and a side-lobe level down 20dB:
