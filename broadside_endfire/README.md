Compute radiation patterns for different types of **broadside** and **end-fire** antenna-arrays.

(see [here](http://www.idc-online.com/technical_references/pdfs/electronic_engineering/Antenna_arrays.pdf) some intro notes to antenna arrays)

Types of arrays, depending on their current distribution:
- **Uniform array**: currents are the same in all elements of the array. Gives secondary lobes whenever the elements are more than half-wavelength apart.
- **Binomial array**: currents follow a binomial distribution. Gives no secondary lobes, only a wide primary lobe. 
- **Triangular array**: current ratios are triangular. Gives narrower main lobes than binomial, but with some secondary lobes (althought he secondary lobes are smaller than in the uniform array).
