Compute radiation patterns for different types of **broadside** and **end-fire** antenna-arrays.

- **Binomial array**: gives no secondary lobes, only a wide primary lobe. 
- **Triangular array**: narrower main lobes than binomial, but with some secondary lobes (althought he secondary lobes are smaller than in the uniform array). 
(see [here](http://www.idc-online.com/technical_references/pdfs/electronic_engineering/Antenna_arrays.pdf) some intro notes to antenna arrays)
